/* The package's public surface.
 *
 * Admission test for anything exported here: the app renders it AND the
 * landing page renders it. That is what keeps charts, the PR table, the
 * repository picker, import progress, cohort comparison, the grading report,
 * the sidebar, the workspace switcher and the account menu out — they are
 * product surfaces, not system parts.
 *
 * The grade card joins them in Task 4.
